# Turnip Farm — Database + API Design

**Scope.** This document is the detailed backend design for `turnip-farm`,
implementing the contract in the master plan
(`https://github.com/hoiekim/turnip-farm/blob/main/docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`,
merged Rev 3). It specifies the Postgres schema, index strategy, upsert
semantics, the training-data export pattern, and the full REST API, at a
level of detail intended to be implementable without guessing. Companion
documents: the pose wire-format specification (`POSE_FORMAT.md`); the iOS
contribution design and the ML training design are specified separately.
Stack: Bun + TypeScript + Postgres + R2, per the master plan.

## 1. Design decisions

### 1.1 Labels: Clip → Label is one-to-many (explicit decision)

The master plan states the hierarchy **Source → Clip → Label, one-to-many
at every level**, but its drafted schema also said `labels.clip_id UNIQUE`
with exactly one label row per clip holding a `TEXT[]` of trick names —
which is effectively Clip → Label one-to-one with the multiplicity pushed
into an array column. This document resolves that inconsistency **in favor
of the stated one-to-many hierarchy**:

- **One label row per `(clip_id, trick_name)`.**
- Each row carries its own `taxonomy_version`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- Re-submission of a clip's labels **replaces the clip's whole label set in
  a single transaction** (DELETE existing rows for the clip, INSERT the new
  set). No merge logic, no array surgery.

**Rationale.** The maintainer specified one-to-many at every level; per-name
rows make per-name provenance exact (which taxonomy version was in effect
when *that* name was confirmed, when it was first seen) instead of smearing
it across an array; set-replacement keeps the client's "confirm →
contribute" flow idempotent; and `UNIQUE(clip_id, trick_name)` gives the
database, not application code, the job of deduplicating re-submissions.

Two departures from the master plan's label draft follow from this:

- **No per-label `user_id`.** Only the source's owner ever submits labels
  (the confirmed contribution flow has no community labeling queue), so
  attribution is `labels → clips → sources → source_attribution`, which
  is also the attribution the quarantine flow uses, and it exists only
  for 30 days after the source's last write (§1.2.17). A per-label
  `user_id` would be a second, longer-lived link to the same account.
- **No per-label `start_frame` / `end_frame`.** The label window *is* the
  clip window. The training target is one segment per confirmed clip window
  (master plan §6), so a second, label-level window is redundant. If a
  labeler tightens a window, they edit the clip and re-confirm.

### 1.2 Judgment calls (master plan silent or ambiguous)

1. `models.sha256` added — the model manifest must carry a checksum
   (master plan §4), so the digest lives on the row.
2. `data_quarantine.metrics JSONB` kept from the master plan draft — a
   snapshot of the regression metrics that triggered the quarantine, for
   the review queue.
3. **Purge = hard delete of the source row** (cascades to clips/labels;
   the R2 blob is deleted too). Consequence: "exclude quarantined sources
   from training" is implemented as "exclude sources with an *open*
   (unresolved) quarantine row". A released source rejoins training; a
   purged source is gone entirely.
4. One open quarantine per source, enforced by a partial unique index.
5. Single-resource GETs return **404 (not 403)** for resources the caller
   does not own, so resource IDs are not usable as an ownership oracle.
6. Follows the master plan's `GET /api/models/current` naming for the
   model manifest endpoint (an earlier draft used `/latest`).
7. Pipeline endpoints (`POST /api/models`, `GET /api/labels/export`)
   authenticate with a **service API key**, not Sign in with Apple.
8. Current taxonomy version = `max(taxonomy_version)` over
   `label_taxonomy`; the seed migration inserts version 1, so it is always
   defined.
9. `r2_key` is deterministic: `poses/<source_id>.tkp1.gz`.
   Re-contribution overwrites the same key.
10. Blob integrity is two-layered, because the farm resamples on ingest
    and stores canonical-only (POSE_FORMAT.md §6):
    - **Transport.** The presigned PUT URL requires the client to attach
      a content checksum (`Content-MD5` or `x-amz-checksum-sha256`);
      storage rejects a corrupted upload at write time. The client never
      supplies the stored digest.
    - **Stored.** `sources.sha256` is the SHA-256 of the **canonical**
      `.tkp1.gz` blob bytes as stored — computed by the farm at ingest,
      after resampling to 10 Hz; NULL until ingest completes. A digest of
      the as-sent bytes would be invalidated by ingest for every
      non-10 Hz contribution, so it is never stored.
    A farm-side ingest worker resamples the staged upload to canonical
    10 Hz, stores it at `r2_key`, sets `sources.sha256`, and deletes the
    staged object. Clip submission re-verifies the stored blob against
    `sources.sha256` (`422 BLOB_DIGEST_MISMATCH`); a NULL digest means
    the blob is not ingested yet (`422 BLOB_MISSING`). A source row
    registered but never uploaded is a harmless dangling row that
    self-heals on re-contribution.
11. `updated_at` is set explicitly in every upsert's `DO UPDATE` clause;
    no database triggers.
12. Label names are trimmed at the API boundary; case-insensitive
    duplicates are deduped pre-insert (§5) — a unique index rejects
    duplicates, it does not collapse them. Uniqueness is enforced on
    `(clip_id, lower(trick_name))`; the original casing is preserved in
    storage and the raw string is never altered.
13. **Source ownership is first-writer-wins, proven by a source key.**
    The first contribution of a `video_id` sets its source key: 32 random
    bytes the client generates and keeps (§7.2); the farm stores only
    `sources.source_key_hash`, which is never overwritten. Every later
    read or write of that source must present the key. Rationale: for
    imported files the `video_id` is `SHA-256(file bytes)`, so two
    contributors importing the byte-identical file compute the identical
    ID (master plan §1 caveat). Transferring ownership to the second
    writer would let strangers claim each other's sources; keeping the
    first writer also matches the dedup intent (the second identical
    contribution carries no new bytes). A second contributor registering
    an already-claimed `video_id` without its key receives
    `409 SOURCE_ALREADY_CLAIMED`. Ownership is a key rather than an
    account, so the farm can serve owners without linking sources to
    accounts (§1.2.17).
14. **Sessions, not per-request identity tokens.** Apple's guidance is
    to verify the identity token once and then run your own session:
    "After verifying the identity token, your app is responsible for
    managing the user session", and "User interaction is required any
    time a new identity token is requested" (Apple, *Verifying a user*).
    Identity tokens are observed to expire about ten minutes after issue
    (Apple doesn't document the figure), and the device cannot refresh
    them silently, so verifying them on every request would lock users
    out minutes after sign-in. The farm verifies the identity token
    once, at `POST /api/auth/apple`, and issues its own opaque session
    token (§7.1). The API stays stateless in the deployment sense:
    sessions live in Postgres, not in process memory.
15. **Apple's refresh token is kept, encrypted, for revocation only.**
    App Review guideline 5.1.1(v) requires in-app account deletion, and
    apps using Sign in with Apple should revoke the user's tokens through
    the REST API when an account is deleted. Revocation needs a refresh
    or access token, so sign-in exchanges the authorization code and
    stores the refresh token encrypted (§3, §7.1). Revoking it
    invalidates "the tokens and associated user authorizations for a
    user" (Apple, *Token revocation*), so the latest token per user is
    enough even across devices; each sign-in replaces it. The farm does
    **not** run Apple's optional daily refresh-token validation: Apple
    throttles it, server-to-server notifications (§7.3) report revoked
    consent and deleted Apple Accounts, and the client checks
    `getCredentialState` on launch (§7.1).
16. **Blocked users can still leave.** `is_blocked` removes contribution
    rights, not the right to sign out or delete the account (§7.1).
17. **Contributions are linked to an account for 30 days at most.** The
    farm needs to know *who* contributed for one purpose: finding and
    blocking an account that poisons the dataset (master plan §6), which
    takes days, not years. So `sources` carries no account column.
    Instead, a `source_attribution` row links a source to the account
    that last wrote it. Every contribution write refreshes it, and it is
    deleted 30 days after the source's last write: a source that is still
    being edited stays linked, and one left alone is unlinked 30 days
    after its last edit. Nothing else needs the link. Ownership is the
    source key (§1.2.13), training splits by source rather than by user,
    and reputation is not computed from contributions (§9 Q2). Reports
    are the one other place an account meets a contribution:
    `reports.reporter_user_id` sits next to a `target_id`, and since
    only a source's key holder can see it, the reporter is usually its
    contributor. Reports are therefore deleted 30 days after they are
    filed, by the same purge (§4). Once unlinked, the farm treats a
    contribution as belonging to no account.
    Some linkage remains possible outside the farm's records: a pose
    sequence can be matched against a public video of the person in it,
    and anyone holding an imported file can recompute its `video_id`.
    Whether that makes unlinked contributions personal data is a question
    for counsel (§9 Q9).

## 2. Conventions

- Postgres 16+. Additive migrations via `dbmate` (`db/migrations/`),
  never destructive; every migration is additive and re-runnable.
  One-time exception (maintainer decision, 2026-10-12): unlinking
  sources from accounts (§1.2.17) drops `sources.user_id` and
  `data_quarantine.user_id`. This is allowed because it lands before
  the first deployment, when no environment holds data. After it,
  earlier migrations can re-apply only to the schema they produced, so
  the re-runnability check is per migration: CI unrecords the newest
  migration and applies it again.
- `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;` for `gen_random_uuid()`.
- All timestamps `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `DEFAULT now()`.
- Identifiers: `sources.id` is the deterministic 64-char lowercase hex
  digest from the client; `clips.id` is a client-minted UUIDv4 the farm
  never mints; every other PK is `gen_random_uuid()`.
- No PII columns anywhere (see §8).

The seed migration inserts the version-1 taxonomy rows, e.g.:

```sql
INSERT INTO label_taxonomy (raw, canonical, taxonomy_version) VALUES
  ('cork', 'cork', 1),
  ('corkscrew', 'cork', 1),
  ('gainer', 'gainer', 1),
  ('cartfull', 'cartfull', 1),
  ('hook', 'hook', 1),
  ('scoot', 'scoot', 1)
ON CONFLICT (raw, taxonomy_version) DO NOTHING;
```

(The real seed list comes from the standard tricking vocabulary; the
curation process itself is a separate concern — master plan §9 Q1.)

## 4. Upsert semantics

Every write is keyed on a client-supplied identity, which is what makes
re-submission idempotent. No `Idempotency-Key` header is needed; the IDs
*are* the idempotency keys.

**`users`** — identity row, written only at sign-in (§7.1), keyed by the
Apple `sub`; a re-sign-in replaces only the stored Apple refresh token:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, apple_refresh_token) VALUES ($1, $2)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  apple_refresh_token = EXCLUDED.apple_refresh_token,
  updated_at          = now()
RETURNING is_blocked;
```

Contribution never writes `users`. `reputation` / `is_blocked` change only
through the moderation path.

**`sessions`** — one row per sign-in; a user may hold several (one per
device or install). Sign-in purges expired rows, then inserts:

```sql
DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expires_at < now();
INSERT INTO sessions (user_id, token_hash, expires_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, now() + interval '90 days');
```

**`sources`** — full replace on re-contribution, except ownership. `$2`
is the SHA-256 hex of the presented source key:

```sql
INSERT INTO sources
  (id, source_key_hash, frame_count, sample_rate, keypoint_format, r2_key, updated_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, 'poses/' || $1 || '.tkp1.gz', now())
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  -- source_key_hash is deliberately NOT overwritten: first writer wins (§1.2.13).
  -- sha256 is deliberately NOT overwritten: owned by ingest (§1.2.10).
  frame_count     = EXCLUDED.frame_count,
  sample_rate     = EXCLUDED.sample_rate,
  keypoint_format = EXCLUDED.keypoint_format,
  r2_key          = EXCLUDED.r2_key,
  updated_at      = now()
WHERE sources.source_key_hash = EXCLUDED.source_key_hash
RETURNING (xmax = 0) AS inserted;
-- no row → claimed under another key → 409 SOURCE_ALREADY_CLAIMED
-- inserted → 201; otherwise → 200
```

**`source_attribution`** — every contribution write (`POST /api/sources`,
`POST /api/clips`, `POST /api/clips/:id/labels`) records the caller as
the source's last writer, in the same transaction:

```sql
INSERT INTO source_attribution (source_id, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2)
ON CONFLICT (source_id) DO UPDATE SET
  user_id       = EXCLUDED.user_id,
  attributed_at = now();
```

The farm process deletes expired rows at startup and hourly, together
with reports past the same window (§1.2.17):

```sql
DELETE FROM source_attribution WHERE attributed_at < now() - interval '30 days';
DELETE FROM reports            WHERE created_at    < now() - interval '30 days';
```

Every read of `source_attribution` also filters on
`attributed_at >= now() - interval '30 days'`, so a late purge never
extends the link.

**`clips`** — batch upsert, one statement for the whole batch:

```sql
INSERT INTO clips
  (id, source_id, start_frame, end_frame, auto_detected, updated_at)
VALUES (...), (...)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  source_id     = EXCLUDED.source_id,
  start_frame   = EXCLUDED.start_frame,
  end_frame     = EXCLUDED.end_frame,
  auto_detected = EXCLUDED.auto_detected,
  updated_at    = now();
```

**`labels`** — never upserted per-row; the whole set per clip is replaced
(§5).

**`label_taxonomy`** — mappings are immutable per version (curation path):

```sql
INSERT INTO label_taxonomy (raw, canonical, taxonomy_version)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3)
ON CONFLICT (raw, taxonomy_version) DO NOTHING;
```

**`models`** — versions are never re-published:

```sql
INSERT INTO models
  (version, taxonomy_version, r2_key, sha256, byte_size, min_client_version,
   input_desc, output_desc, holdout_report_r2_key, training_run_id,
   val_metrics, promoted_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, now())
ON CONFLICT (version) DO NOTHING;
-- rowcount 0 → 409 VERSION_EXISTS
```

**`data_quarantine`** — plain append-only `INSERT`; the partial unique
index rejects a second open quarantine for the same source.

## 5. Label-set replacement transaction

`POST /api/clips` (batch) and `POST /api/clips/:id/labels` converge on one
primitive: **replace the label set of a clip**. It runs inside the same
transaction as the clip upserts, so a batch is all-or-nothing:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- 1. current taxonomy version, once per transaction
SELECT max(taxonomy_version) INTO v_tax FROM label_taxonomy;

-- 2. clip upserts (§4)

-- 3. per clip in the batch:
DELETE FROM labels WHERE clip_id = $1;
INSERT INTO labels (clip_id, trick_name, taxonomy_version)
SELECT $1, deduped.name, v_tax
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (lower(trim(name))) trim(name) AS name
  FROM unnest($2::text[]) AS name
  WHERE trim(name) <> ''
  ORDER BY lower(trim(name)), trim(name)
) AS deduped;
-- (empty array → DELETE only; the clip is left unlabeled)
-- Dedup on lower(trim(name)) BEFORE insert: the unique index on
-- (clip_id, lower(trick_name)) rejects duplicates, it does not collapse
-- them. DISTINCT ON keeps the alphabetically-first casing per group.

COMMIT;
```

Properties:

- **Idempotent.** Submitting the same set twice yields the same rows
  (same `(clip_id, lower(trick_name))`, fresh timestamps on the second
  write — timestamps are provenance, not identity).
- **Atomic.** A batch that fails validation rolls back entirely; the
  farm never holds half a contribution.
- **No merge logic.** The client is the source of truth for "what are
  this clip's names right now"; the farm does not diff.

## 6. Training-data queries (quarantine exclusion)

The training export must exclude quarantined sources. Because a purge
hard-deletes the source row (§1.2.3), "quarantined" for training purposes
means **has an open (unresolved) quarantine row**:

```sql
SELECT s.id            AS source_id,
       s.r2_key,
       s.sha256        AS blob_sha256,
       c.id            AS clip_id,
       c.start_frame,
       c.end_frame,
       l.trick_name,                    -- raw; canonicalized via label_taxonomy
       l.taxonomy_version,
       GREATEST(s.updated_at, c.updated_at, l.updated_at) AS row_cursor
FROM sources s
JOIN clips  c ON c.source_id = s.id
JOIN labels l ON l.clip_id   = c.id
LEFT JOIN data_quarantine q
       ON q.source_id = s.id AND q.resolved_at IS NULL
WHERE q.id IS NULL
  AND (GREATEST(s.updated_at, c.updated_at, l.updated_at), c.id, l.trick_name)
      > ($1, $2, $3)  -- since cursor: (row_cursor, clip_id, trick_name)
ORDER BY row_cursor ASC, clip_id ASC, trick_name ASC
LIMIT 10000;
```

Notes:

- Sources with no labels contribute no rows. (Unlabeled *regions* of
  labeled sources serve as background negatives — derived from clip
  windows, not from label-less sources.)
- Keyset is on `(row_cursor, clip_id, trick_name)`, not `row_cursor`
  alone: `row_cursor` ties are guaranteed, not rare — §5 replaces a
  clip's label set in the same transaction as the clip upserts, and
  Postgres `now()` returns the transaction start, so every row a batch
  touches shares the exact same `updated_at`. Keying on `row_cursor`
  alone with `next_cursor = max(row_cursor)` would silently skip rows
  sharing the max cursor value past the `LIMIT` boundary.
- `next_cursor` = `(row_cursor, clip_id, trick_name)` of the last
  returned row; the training job passes all three back as `since`.
- **The export carries no deletions.** A source deleted by its owner,
  by account deletion, or by a quarantine purge, and a label dropped
  when a clip's label set is replaced, simply stop appearing. An
  incremental pull never learns of them. The training job therefore
  builds every dataset from a **full pull** (no `since`) and discards
  any locally cached pose blob whose source is absent from it. `since`
  is only for cheap change detection, such as counting new labels
  before deciding to train.
- No account identifier is exported (§1.2.17). Training splits by
  source.
- Canonicalization (`raw → canonical`) happens in the training job using
  the `taxonomy` block shipped with the export response (§7,
  `GET /api/labels/export`), not in SQL.

## 7. API

Base path `/api`. JSON request/response bodies, UTF-8. Timestamps are
RFC 3339 (`2026-10-06T07:30:00Z`).

### 7.1 Authentication

**Client sessions** (every endpoint not named below). The client signs
in once with `POST /api/auth/apple` (§7.3), the only client endpoint
that sees Apple tokens, and receives a farm session token (§1.2.14).
Every other client request sends `Authorization: Bearer <session token>`.
The farm hashes the token and looks it up:

```sql
SELECT s.id, s.user_id, s.last_used_at, u.is_blocked
FROM sessions s
JOIN users u ON u.id = s.user_id
WHERE s.token_hash = $1 AND s.expires_at > now();
```

No row → `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`; the client discards the token and signs
in again. `is_blocked` → `403 ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, except on
`POST /api/auth/signout` and `DELETE /api/account` (§1.2.16). Otherwise
the request runs as the session's user. Account data (sessions, the
account itself) is scoped with `user_id = <session user_id>`;
contributions are reached only through source keys (§7.2), so there is
no cross-user access either way. When `last_used_at` is more than a day
old, the session slides forward:

```sql
UPDATE sessions
SET last_used_at = now(), expires_at = now() + interval '90 days'
WHERE id = $1 AND last_used_at < now() - interval '1 day';
```

A session token is 32 bytes from a CSPRNG, base64url-encoded without
padding (43 characters); the farm stores only its lowercase hex SHA-256
(`sessions.token_hash`). The token carries no claims. The row is the
source of truth, so sign-out, revoked consent, and account deletion end
sessions immediately. Sessions expire after 90 days without use; Apple
notes that "User sessions are long-lived on device".

**Pipeline** (`POST /api/models`, `GET /api/labels/export`): pre-shared
service key, `Authorization: Bearer <TURNIP_PIPELINE_KEY>`.

**Apple** (`POST /api/auth/apple/notifications`): no bearer token; the
body is a JWT signed by Apple, verified as below.

**Verifying an Apple JWT.** The identity token at sign-in, the `id_token`
returned by the code exchange, and server-to-server notifications are
checked the same way: RS256 signature against Apple's JWKS
(`https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys`; cached, key matched by `kid`,
refetched when an unknown `kid` appears), `iss = https://appleid.apple.com`,
`aud = APP_BUNDLE_ID`, and `exp` within a 60-second clock-skew leeway.
Notifications carry `iat` and `jti` but no `exp`, so `exp` is required
only on identity tokens. The farm reads only `sub` (and, for
notifications, `events`); Apple's email claims are never stored or
logged (§8).

**Apple credentials.** The code exchange and token revocation
authenticate the farm to Apple with `client_id = APP_BUNDLE_ID` and a
client secret: an ES256 JWT signed with the Sign in with Apple private
key, header `{"alg": "ES256", "kid": APPLE_KEY_ID}`, claims
`iss = APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `sub = APP_BUNDLE_ID`,
`aud = https://appleid.apple.com`, `iat` = now, and `exp` no more than
six months later (Apple's limit). Configuration: `APP_BUNDLE_ID`,
`APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `.p8` PEM), and
`APPLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` (32 random bytes, base64: the AES-256-GCM key
for `users.apple_refresh_token`).

**Client contract** (turnip-ios):

- Per sign-in attempt, generate a random raw nonce, set
  `ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest.nonce` to its lowercase hex SHA-256, and
  send the raw nonce with `identityToken` and `authorizationCode` to
  `POST /api/auth/apple`. The code is single-use and valid for five
  minutes, so send it right away.
- Keep the session token in the Keychain with
  `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, so background
  uploads can read it and it never migrates to another device.
- On launch, call `getCredentialState(forUserID:)`. On `.revoked` or
  `.notFound`, call `POST /api/auth/signout`, delete the token, and show
  the signed-out state. Also observe `credentialRevokedNotification`.
- On any `401`, delete the token and sign in again.
- When a source is first contributed, generate its source key (§7.2)
  and keep it in the Keychain under its `video_id`, with the same
  accessibility as the session token. Keychain items survive app
  deletion and reinstall on current iOS, but Apple doesn't guarantee
  it, so a lost key is an expected state, not an error.
- Account deletion: delete every source the app holds a key for, then
  call `DELETE /api/account`, then delete the local keys and session
  token (§7.3).
- Disclosure, shown at contribution consent and again at account
  deletion: contributions stay linked to the account for 30 days after
  the last edit, and after that are kept without any link to it.
  Deleting the account removes every contribution the app can still
  find. The rest can't be traced back to the user and remain in the
  training data. The consent copy also asks users to contribute only
  clips of themselves, or of people who agreed: the person in a clip
  may not be the account holder.

### 7.2 Conventions

- **Idempotency** comes from client-supplied IDs (§4); no extra headers.
- **Errors** share one shape:

  ```json
  {"error": {"code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "...", "details": {}}}
  ```

  Codes: `UNAUTHENTICATED` (401), `ACCOUNT_BLOCKED` (403), `NOT_FOUND`
  (404), `NO_MODEL` (404), `VALIDATION_ERROR` (422), `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` (422),
  `BLOB_MISSING` (422), `BLOB_DIGEST_MISMATCH` (422),
  `SOURCE_ALREADY_CLAIMED` (409), `VERSION_EXISTS` (409),
  `RATE_LIMITED` (429), `INTERNAL` (500), `APPLE_UNAVAILABLE` (503:
  Apple's token or revocation endpoint is unreachable or answered 5xx;
  retry later).
- **Source keys** prove ownership of a source (§1.2.13).
  - **What a key is:** 32 random bytes the client generates once per
    source when it first contributes it, sent base64url-encoded without
    padding (43 characters). The farm stores only its SHA-256 hex
    (`sources.source_key_hash`).
  - **How it travels:**
    - the `source_key` field on `POST /api/sources` and
      `POST /api/clips/:id/labels`;
    - a per-clip `source_key` in the `POST /api/clips` batch;
    - a `Source-Key` header on `GET /api/sources/:id`,
      `GET /api/sources/:id/pose` and `DELETE /api/sources/:id`.
  - **Two credentials:** contribution endpoints need both a session and
    the key. The session is for rate limiting, blocking, and attribution
    (§1.2.17); the key is for ownership.
  - **Losing it:** a client that loses a key (e.g. its Keychain is
    gone) can no longer manage that source. It treats the source as
    contributed but unmanageable.
- **Ownership privacy:** a missing or wrong source key gets
  `404 NOT_FOUND` (not 403) on reads, deletes, and clip writes, so
  resource IDs are not usable as an ownership oracle. Registration is
  the one exception: a `video_id` already claimed under another key
  gets `409 SOURCE_ALREADY_CLAIMED`.
- **Rate limiting:** per-user token bucket on POST endpoints
  (suggested: 60 requests/minute; `429 RATE_LIMITED` with
  `Retry-After`). `POST /api/auth/apple` has no user yet, so it is
  limited per client IP (suggested: 10 requests/minute).

### 7.3 Endpoints

#### `POST /api/auth/apple` — sign in, get a session token

No session required. Request:

```json
{
  "identity_token": "<ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential.identityToken>",
  "authorization_code": "<ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential.authorizationCode>",
  "nonce": "<raw nonce; its SHA-256 hex was set on the Apple request>"
}
```

Behavior, in order:

1. Verify `identity_token` as an Apple JWT (§7.1), and require its
   `nonce` claim to equal the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the request's
   `nonce`. Any failure → `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`.
2. Exchange the code: `POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token`, form
   fields `client_id`, `client_secret` (§7.1), `code`,
   `grant_type=authorization_code` (no `redirect_uri` for a native app).
   Apple's `invalid_grant` (code expired, already used, or revoked) →
   `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`. Unreachable, timeout, or 5xx →
   `503 APPLE_UNAVAILABLE`. Any other error (e.g. `invalid_client`)
   means the farm is misconfigured → `500 INTERNAL`.
3. Verify the response's `id_token` as an Apple JWT (§7.1); its `sub`
   must equal the identity token's `sub`, else `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`.
4. In one transaction: upsert the user with the encrypted
   `refresh_token`, purge expired sessions, and insert the new session
   (§4).

A blocked user still gets a session (§1.2.16); every other endpoint
then answers `403 ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`.

Response `200`:

```json
{"session_token": "<43-char base64url>", "expires_at": "2027-01-04T07:00:00Z"}
```

#### `POST /api/auth/signout` — end this session

Deletes the session whose `token_hash` matches the bearer token, if
any. `204` whether or not a session matched, so a client can always
sign out cleanly. Allowed for blocked users.

#### `DELETE /api/account` — delete my account

App Review guideline 5.1.1(v). Session required; allowed for blocked
users.

**Client first.** Contributions are not linked to the account beyond
the attribution window (§1.2.17), so the farm cannot find them all.
Before calling this endpoint, the app deletes every source it holds a
key for, with `DELETE /api/sources/:id`. The farm cannot enforce this
step. Contributions whose keys the app no longer holds, and that are
past the window, remain as training data that no record links to the
user. The app says so when the user contributes and again when they
delete the account (§7.1, §8).

**Then the server**, in order, so a retry after a partial failure
finishes the job:

1. If `users.apple_refresh_token` is set, decrypt it and revoke it:
   `POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke`, form fields
   `client_id`, `client_secret` (§7.1), `token`,
   `token_type_hint=refresh_token`. Apple answers `200` both when it
   revokes the token and when the token was already invalid.
   Unreachable, timeout, or 5xx → `503 APPLE_UNAVAILABLE` with nothing
   deleted. Any other error is logged and deletion proceeds: the user's
   right to delete does not depend on Apple's answer.
2. Delete every source still attributed to the user (within the
   window, §4): first its R2 blob and any staged upload, then the row.
   Clips, labels, quarantine rows, and attribution cascade.
3. `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1`. Sessions, reports, and any
   remaining attribution rows cascade.

Response `204`. A retry after success gets `401` (the session is gone).

#### `POST /api/auth/apple/notifications` — Apple server-to-server notifications

Apple posts here when a user changes their Sign in with Apple account;
the URL is registered for the App ID in the Apple Developer account
(§9). No session; authenticity comes from Apple's signature. Body:

```json
{"payload": "<JWT signed by Apple>"}
```

Verify `payload` as an Apple JWT (§7.1); failure → `401`. The `events`
claim is documented as an object; parse it if it arrives as a
JSON-encoded string instead. Apple's documented shape:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://appleid.apple.com",
  "aud": "<APP_BUNDLE_ID>",
  "iat": 1508184845,
  "jti": "abede...67890",
  "events": {
    "type": "consent-revoked",
    "sub": "820417.faa325acbc78e1be1668ba852d492d8a.0219",
    "event_time": 1508184845
  }
}
```

By `events.type`, for the user `events.sub`:

- `consent-revoked` (the user stopped using Sign in with Apple for the
  app): delete all their sessions and set `apple_refresh_token = NULL`
  (Apple has already invalidated it). Contributions stay; the user can
  sign in again, or delete the account.
- `account-deleted` (the user deleted their Apple Account; Apple has
  invalidated all their tokens, and they can never sign in again to
  delete their data): run `DELETE /api/account` steps 2 and 3. Sources
  past the attribution window are not linked to the account and stay.
- `email-enabled`, `email-disabled`: ignored. These events carry an
  email address, which the farm never stores or logs.

An unknown `sub` or `type` is a no-op. Response `200` once handled;
`500` on a transient failure (e.g. R2 unreachable), since whether Apple
redelivers is undocumented (§9).

#### `POST /api/sources` — register a source, get the blob upload URL

Request:

```json
{
  "video_id": "<64-char lowercase hex>",
  "source_key": "<43-char base64url; generated by the client for this source>",
  "frame_count": 600,
  "sample_rate": 10.0,
  "keypoint_format": "tkp1"
}
```

Validation: `video_id` matches `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`; `source_key` is 43
base64url characters (§7.2); `frame_count > 0`; `sample_rate` in
`1..30` Hz (the normative client analysis range, POSE_FORMAT.md §6);
`keypoint_format` must be `tkp1` (anything else →
`422 UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`).

Behavior: upserts the source row per §4 (`r2_key =
poses/<video_id>.tkp1.gz`; `source_key_hash` set on insert and never
overwritten; `sha256` left for ingest), and records the caller in
`source_attribution` (§4). If the `video_id` is already claimed under a
different key → `409 SOURCE_ALREADY_CLAIMED` (the farm already holds
this source).

Response (`201` new, `200` re-registered):

```json
{
  "source_id": "<video_id>",
  "r2_key": "poses/<video_id>.tkp1.gz",
  "upload_url": "<presigned R2 PUT, 15-minute expiry>",
  "upload_expires_at": "2026-10-06T08:00:00Z",
  "blob_present": false
}
```

`blob_present` is true when the canonical blob is stored
(`sources.sha256 IS NOT NULL`); the client skips the PUT and goes
straight to clip submission. `frame_count` is the canonical 10 Hz count
(client computes it per POSE_FORMAT.md §6); clip windows submitted later are
validated against it, so the whole API speaks canonical indices.

The client then `PUT`s the `.tkp1.gz` blob to `upload_url` with
`Content-Type: application/gzip` and a `Content-MD5` (or
`x-amz-checksum-sha256`) checksum header — the URL rejects a checksum
mismatch at write time, which is the transport-integrity layer
(§1.2.10). The upload lands on a staging key; the ingest worker
resamples it to canonical 10 Hz, stores it at `r2_key`, sets
`sources.sha256`, and deletes the staged object. The client waits for
ingest (poll registration until `blob_present`, or retry clip
submission), then submits clips (§7.3 `POST /api/clips`). A source row
with no ingested blob yet is a harmless dangling row; it self-heals
when the client re-registers and uploads.

#### `POST /api/clips` — batch upsert clips + replace their label sets

Request:

```json
{
  "clips": [
    {
      "clip_id": "<uuidv4, client-minted>",
      "source_id": "<64-char hex>",
      "source_key": "<the source's key>",
      "start_frame": 120,
      "end_frame": 175,
      "auto_detected": false,
      "labels": ["cork"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Behavior, in a single transaction:

1. For each clip: the source must exist, its `source_key` must match,
   and an existing `clip_id` must already belong to that source (clips
   never move between sources). Otherwise the whole batch fails with
   `404 NOT_FOUND`.
2. `0 <= start_frame < end_frame <= source.frame_count`, else
   `422 VALIDATION_ERROR` (with the batch index and field in `details`).
3. **Blob verification** (once per distinct source in the batch): the
   canonical blob must be ingested — `sources.sha256 IS NULL` →
   `422 BLOB_MISSING` (the client waits for ingest, re-uploads via
   `POST /api/sources`, and retries). Otherwise fetch the R2 object at
   `r2_key` and compare its SHA-256 against `sources.sha256`; a
   mismatch → `422 BLOB_DIGEST_MISMATCH`.
4. Upsert the clip rows (§4).
5. Replace each clip's label set (§5); `labels` is optional per clip and
   may be `[]` (clears the set).
6. Record the caller in `source_attribution` for each distinct source
   (§4).

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "clips": [
    {"clip_id": "<uuid>", "labels": ["cork"], "taxonomy_version": 3}
  ]
}
```

`labels` entries are trimmed; blank entries are dropped;
case-insensitive duplicates are deduped before insert (§5).

#### `POST /api/clips/:id/labels` — replace one clip's label set

Request:

```json
{"source_key": "<the key of the clip's source>", "labels": ["hook", "scoot", "gainer", "cartfull"]}
```

Behavior: the clip must exist and `source_key` must match its source
(`404` otherwise); runs the §5 replacement for that clip only and
records the caller in `source_attribution` (§4). Idempotent: submitting
the current set is a no-op semantically.

Response `200`:

```json
{"clip_id": "<uuid>", "labels": ["hook", "scoot", "gainer", "cartfull"], "taxonomy_version": 3}
```

There is no "list my sources" endpoint: the farm doesn't know which
sources are whose (§1.2.17). The client knows, from the source keys it
holds.

#### `GET /api/sources/:id` — source with confirmed clips + labels

`Source-Key` header required. Response `200` (`404` if missing or the
key doesn't match):

```json
{
  "source": {
    "id": "<video_id>",
    "frame_count": 600,
    "sample_rate": 10.0,
    "keypoint_format": "tkp1",
    "sha256": "<canonical blob digest; null until ingested>",
    "created_at": "2026-10-06T07:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-10-06T07:00:00Z"
  },
  "clips": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "start_frame": 120,
      "end_frame": 175,
      "auto_detected": false,
      "labels": [
        {"trick_name": "cork", "taxonomy_version": 3, "created_at": "..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the reinstall-reconciliation read. The client reads the source
keys left in its Keychain (stored per `video_id`), recomputes the
`video_id`s of the videos it still has, and pulls each matching
source's clips + labels, adopting the server's clip IDs into its
rebuilt local state (master plan §5.1).

#### `GET /api/sources/:id/pose` — owner-only pose blob download

`Source-Key` header required. Response `200` (`404` if missing or the
key doesn't match):

```json
{
  "url": "<presigned R2 GET for poses/<id>.tkp1.gz, 15-minute expiry>",
  "expires_at": "2026-10-06T08:00:00Z"
}
```

Used by a device that no longer holds the local video but still holds
the key (e.g. reinstall restore) to render skeleton previews from
keypoints alone. Presigned per request, scoped to the single blob; the
key requirement is what keeps one contributor's pose sequences from
ever being downloadable by another.

#### `DELETE /api/sources/:id` — owner-only hard delete

`Source-Key` header required. Deletes the R2 blob and the source row;
clips, labels, quarantine rows, and attribution cascade. `204` on
success (`404` if missing or the key doesn't match). This is the "keep
forever, user-deletable" retention posture (master plan §4): deletable
by whoever holds the key.

#### `GET /api/models/current` — trick-model manifest

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "version": "trick-v1.2",
  "model_type": "trick-detection",
  "taxonomy_version": 3,
  "r2_key": "models/trick-v1.2.mlmodelc.zip",
  "url": "<presigned R2 GET, 15-minute expiry>",
  "sha256": "<64-char hex of the artifact bytes>",
  "byte_size": 48203110,
  "min_client_version": "2.4.0",
  "input_desc": {"layout": "T×52", "channels": "gap-channel pose features", "rate_hz": 10},
  "output_desc": {"segments": "source-frame coordinates", "trick_names": "string[]", "is_combo": "derived"},
  "holdout_report_r2_key": "reports/trick-v1.2-holdout.json",
  "training_run_id": "run-20261006-01",
  "val_metrics": {"seg_map_05": 0.62, "name_accuracy": 0.81},
  "vocabulary": [
    {"canonical": "cork", "aliases": ["cork", "corkscrew"]},
    {"canonical": "gainer", "aliases": ["gainer"]}
  ],
  "promoted_at": "2026-10-06T06:00:00Z"
}
```

`vocabulary` is built from `label_taxonomy` at the model's
`taxonomy_version`: one entry per canonical name, `aliases` = every raw
string mapped to it. The client verifies the download against `sha256`
before installing. `404 NO_MODEL` when nothing has been promoted yet.

#### `POST /api/models` — pipeline publishes the champion (service key)

Request:

```json
{
  "version": "trick-v1.2",
  "taxonomy_version": 3,
  "r2_key": "models/trick-v1.2.mlmodelc.zip",
  "sha256": "<64-char hex>",
  "byte_size": 48203110,
  "min_client_version": "2.4.0",
  "input_desc": {"layout": "T×52", "channels": "gap-channel pose features", "rate_hz": 10},
  "output_desc": {"segments": "source-frame coordinates", "trick_names": "string[]", "is_combo": "derived"},

  "training_run_id": "run-20261006-01",
  "val_metrics": {"seg_map_05": 0.62, "name_accuracy": 0.81}
}
```

Behavior: inserts per §4 with `promoted_at = now()`; an existing
`version` → `409 VERSION_EXISTS` (bump the version instead). Response
`201`: `{"id": "<uuid>", "version": "...", "promoted_at": "..."}`.

#### `GET /api/labels/export?since=` — training pull (service key)

`since` is the opaque cursor from the previous response's `next_cursor`
(the §6 `(row_cursor, clip_id, trick_name)` triple, encoded opaquely);
omit for a full pull. Returns label-granular rows (one per label row), quarantined
sources excluded, ordered by cursor ascending, `limit` 10000:

```json
{
  "rows": [
    {
      "source_id": "<video_id>",
      "r2_key": "poses/<video_id>.tkp1.gz",
      "blob_sha256": "<64-char hex>",
      "clip_id": "<uuid>",
      "start_frame": 120,
      "end_frame": 175,
      "trick_name": "cork",
      "taxonomy_version": 3
    }
  ],
  "taxonomy": [
    {"raw": "corkscrew", "canonical": "cork", "taxonomy_version": 3}
  ],
  "next_cursor": "<opaque>"  // null when exhausted
}
```

`taxonomy` carries the `(raw → canonical)` mappings for the versions
present in `rows`, so the training job canonicalizes without a second
call. The training job resolves each row's `r2_key` to pose bytes itself
(R2 access, verifying `blob_sha256`).

#### `POST /api/reports` — report a bad label/clip

Request:

```json
{"target_type": "clip", "target_id": "<uuid>", "reason": "wrong trick name"}
```

`target_type` ∈ `source | clip | label`. Response `201`:
`{"id": "<report uuid>"}`. Reports are a moderation queue for future
use; they do not change training data by themselves. A report is
deleted 30 days after it is filed (§1.2.17, §4), reviewed or not.

## 8. What the farm never accepts or stores

Restating the privacy boundary (master plan §1) as an implementation
checklist:

- No video pixels, audio, thumbnails, or contact sheets — in any table,
  blob, log, or error payload.
- No location, EXIF, photo-library identifiers, or device identifiers.
  The `PHAsset.localIdentifier` **never leaves the device**; the farm
  sees only its SHA-256-derived digest, which it cannot reverse.
- No Apple profile data beyond the `sub` claim: no name, no email.
  Identity tokens and email notifications carry an email address; it is
  discarded unread.
- R2 keys contain only the opaque source ID
  (`poses/<video_id>.tkp1.gz`); presigned URLs are per-request,
  single-blob, short-lived.
- Credentials are stored only in protected form: session tokens as
  SHA-256 hashes, Apple refresh tokens AES-256-GCM encrypted (§3).
- Request logs and error payloads never contain Apple identity tokens,
  authorization codes, refresh tokens, session tokens, source keys, or
  pose data.
- Contributions carry no account identifier. The only link is
  `source_attribution`, deleted 30 days after a source's last write
  (§1.2.17), and nothing may outlive it:
  - **Logs:** request logs never record a user ID or session ID next to
    a source or clip ID. The farm's logs and the reverse proxy's access
    logs are kept 30 days at most.
  - **Backups:** database backups are kept 30 days at most.
  - **Alerts:** anti-poisoning alerts name sources and counts, never
    accounts. The maintainer reads attribution from the database while
    it exists.
  - **Exports:** nothing exported to training carries an account
    identifier (§6).
  - **Reports:** deleted 30 days after they are filed, since the
    reporter is usually the target's contributor (§1.2.17).
- Account deletion (§7.3) removes the account, its sessions, and every
  contribution still attributed to it or still keyed on the device.
  Contributions the device can no longer find stay, unlinked; users are
  told so at consent and at deletion. Deleted data leaves the next
  training dataset, because training rebuilds from a full pull (§6).
  Models already trained on it are treated as anonymous, pending the
  assessment in §9 Q8.

## 9. Open questions

1. **Pipeline key management.** Who issues and rotates
   `TURNIP_PIPELINE_KEY`, and where is it stored? (Ops decision.)
2. **Reputation formula.** *Settled by §1.2.17:* reputation is not
   computed from contributions, which keep no lasting account link, and
   `users.reputation` stays unused. Any future per-account signal has
   to come from account-level events, such as confirmed reports.
3. **Apple token verification cost.** *Resolved:* identity tokens are
   verified once, at sign-in; requests carry farm session tokens
   (§1.2.14, §7.1).
4. **R2 topology.** Bucket, region, and presigned-URL TTL policy are ops
   details not specified here (15-minute TTLs assumed above).
5. **Taxonomy curation.** Who canonicalizes new free-text names and
   bumps `taxonomy_version` (master plan §9 Q1) — the versioning
   mechanics are specified here; the human process is not.
6. **Apple key and secret management.** Where `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` and
   `APPLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` live, and how the latter rotates. A
   rotation needs a key ID on the stored ciphertext, which §3 does not
   have yet. (Ops decision.)
7. **Server-to-server notifications.** The endpoint URL must be
   registered for the App ID in the Apple Developer account, and Apple
   does not document redelivery. A missed `account-deleted` leaves that
   user's data until an operator removes it. (Ops decision.)
8. **Trained-model anonymity.** Every device receives the model, so
   treating it as anonymous needs a documented assessment (EDPB Opinion
   28/2024): a membership-inference check in the holdout evaluation,
   and confirmation that no pose sequences ship inside model artifacts.
   Owned by the training design.
9. **Residual linkage.** Unlinked contributions can still be matched
   against a public video of the person in them, and an imported
   file's `video_id` can be recomputed by anyone holding the file
   (§1.2.17). Counsel should confirm whether that leaves them personal
   data.
10. **Log and backup retention.** §8 caps logs and database backups at
    30 days; the deployment runbook has to implement that for Postgres
    backups, the farm's logs, and the reverse proxy's access logs.
