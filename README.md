# turnip-farm

Backend and training dataset for [Turnip](https://github.com/hoiekim/turnip-ios).
The farm collects confirmed trick clips and free-text trick names from the
iOS app, stores them against on-device pose keypoint sequences, and serves
that dataset to the training pipeline. It never receives video: what leaves
the device is an opaque video ID, the pose keypoints, and the user's
confirmed labels.

How it fits with the other repos:

- [`turnip-ios`](https://github.com/hoiekim/turnip-ios) captures video, runs
  pose detection on-device, and lets the user confirm clips and trick names.
  On confirm it contributes keypoints and labels to the farm.
- **`turnip-farm`** (this repo) is a Bun + TypeScript API over Postgres
  (metadata and labels) and Cloudflare R2 (pose blobs and model artifacts).
- [`turnip-ml`](https://github.com/hoiekim/turnip-ml) pulls the labeled
  dataset from the farm each night, trains the trick-detection model, and
  publishes the champion back through the farm. The iOS app downloads it
  over the air.

The design documents are the contract. Read them before changing behavior:

- [`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`](docs/MASTER_PLAN.md): purpose, privacy boundary,
  and phased rollout across all three repos.
- [`docs/BACKEND_DESIGN.md`](docs/BACKEND_DESIGN.md): Postgres schema, upsert
  semantics, and the full REST API.
- [`docs/POSE_FORMAT.md`](docs/POSE_FORMAT.md): the `TKP1` pose wire and
  storage format.

## Status

This is a scaffold. The service starts, validates its configuration, and
serves `GET /healthz`. The schema and the endpoints are tracked as separate
issues.

## Layout

```
src/
  index.ts         entry point: loads config, starts the server
  app.ts           HTTP routing and the API error shape
  config.ts        env-based configuration; fails fast on missing variables
  *.test.ts        tests (bun test), next to the code they cover
db/
  migrations/      dbmate migrations, additive only (BACKEND_DESIGN.md §2)
docs/              design documents (see above)
.github/workflows/ CI: install, typecheck, test, build
```

## Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14, the version pinned by `packageManager`
in `package.json` and installed by CI.

```sh
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
bun run dev            # watch mode on http://localhost:3000
curl -i localhost:3000/healthz
```

| Command             | What it does                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun test`          | Run the test suite                              |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`                  |
| `bun run build`     | Bundle `src/index.ts` into `dist/`              |
| `bun run start`     | Run the bundle in `dist/` (build first)         |

### Configuration

All configuration comes from environment variables. Bun loads `.env`
automatically. When anything required is missing or invalid, the server
exits with status 1 and lists every problem at once.

| Variable               | Required | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`                 | no       | HTTP listen port (default `3000`)                            |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | yes      | Postgres connection string                                   |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`        | yes      | Cloudflare account that owns the R2 bucket                   |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | yes      | R2 API token access key                                      |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | yes      | R2 API token secret                                          |
| `R2_BUCKET`            | yes      | Bucket for pose blobs and model artifacts                    |
| `APP_BUNDLE_ID`        | yes      | Expected `aud` of Sign in with Apple tokens                  |
| `TURNIP_PIPELINE_KEY`  | yes      | Service key for the training pipeline's endpoints            |

## Contributing

1. **Start from an issue.** Work is tracked in GitHub issues. Each one cites
   the design-doc section it implements.
2. **Change the design first.** A change to the schema, the API, or the pose
   format goes to `docs/` in its own PR before any code depends on it.
3. **Respect the privacy boundary.** The farm never accepts or stores video
   pixels, audio, location, device identifiers, or Apple profile data beyond
   the `sub` claim. Logs never record identity tokens. See
   BACKEND_DESIGN.md §8.
4. **Open a PR against `main`.** Start the description with a
   `## Design alignment` section naming the doc sections it implements, then
   a summary. CI (typecheck, test, build) must be green.
5. **Migrations are additive.** Never edit or drop an applied migration; add
   a new one.
