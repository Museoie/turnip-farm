// Public community stats (BACKEND_DESIGN.md §7.3).
// GET /api/stats — aggregate-only totals and daily series for the public
// site's stats section: user signups and labeling contributions over the
// last 90 UTC days. Public: no session (§7.1, §1.2.19); the per-IP rate
// limit is applied in startServer's fetch wrapper next to the other
// public endpoints. Served with Cache-Control: max-age=60 and no ETag —
// the payload has no single version to hash, and counts move slowly.
//
// Aggregate-only by construction: the queries count rows and bucket by
// day. They never join source_attribution or any other per-account link,
// so no response can tie a contribution to an account (§1, §1.2.17).
// Counts include every row, quarantined or not: this is community
// activity, not the training set, so §6's quarantine exclusion does not
// apply.
